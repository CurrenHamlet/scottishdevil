          <p>The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft is a database containing information about all known individuals accused of witchcraft in early modern Scotland. The database was published in 2003 by Julian Goodare, Lauren Martin, Joyce Miller, and Lousie Yeoman. They intended to “collect, collate and record all known information about accused witches and witchcraft belief in a Microsoft Access database and to create a web-based user interface for the database.” The initial data came from existing surveys of Scottish witchcraft, and two full-time researchers, Joyce Miller and Lauren Martin, conducted additional archival research over two years to complete the Survey. Dr. Julian Goodare, a professor of Scottish history at the University of Edinburgh, served as the director of the Survey's creation, with Dr. Louise Yeoman, a former curator at the National Library of Scotland and researcher with BBC Scotland, as co-director. Charlotte Moon also created a website and database tools for the project.</p>
          <p>The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft (SSW) used three pre-existing surveys to jump-start the research for their own database. First, they used George Black’s 1938 <i>Calendar of Cases of Witchcraft in Scotland: 1510-1727</i>. The SSW used this non-comprehensive survey because it lists close to 1,000 specific trials, and because it includes lists of cases and local published sources. The team acknowledged that this source was limited, because Black did not work with any manuscripts that could have contained more information. The next survey, <i>Source-Book of Scottish Witchcraft</i>, was researched and written by Christia Larner, Christopher Hyde Lee, and Hugh McLachlan, and published in 1977. This survey used manuscripts and had information on 3,000 cases. Stuart Macdonald later revised this survey in the 1990s. From this work, McLachlan created the Scottish Witch Hunt Data Base, and from this database the SSW added 1,000 more cases and expanded the information about each case.</p>
            <p>From here, the SSW was expanded from the use of various sources such as <i>Private Papers</i>
            belonging to the Maxwell of Pollok family, the <i>Burgh Court Books</i>, and <i>Burgh Treasurer’s Accounts</i>, assumed information to specific cases. Miscellaneous manuscript sources were also referenced, such as the <i>Aberdeen City Archives</i>, a box containing items relating to the witchcraft trials from Aberdeen between 1595 and 1597, mostly including paperwork records, as well as printed records of the parliamentary meetings and decisions of Parliament of Scotland. The <i>Miscellany of the Spalding Club Volumes I, IV and V</i>, held edited transcripts of documents from witchcraft trials. These were held in Aberdeen in the 16th century and provided specific case information. The data gathered includes any type of information on trials, lore, investigations, or manuals; anything related to witchcraft in Scotland. Examples of this are present in all of the sources used to compile the data. <i>Orkney Folklore and Traditions</i> informed the research team of folklore traditions in the Orkney Islands, which also included accusations and specific prosecutions. Witchcraft trials were recorded in edited transcripts from <i>Spottiswoode Miscellany: a collection of original papers and tracts, illustrative chiefly of the civil and ecclesiastical history of Scotland, volume 2</i>. They acquired an edited transcript of the Campbells and hereditary jurisdiction from <i>The Justiciary Records of Argyll and the Isles, volume 1</i>. However, like many of the references, it is not a complete record of the proceedings, and the source of compilation is unknown, meaning it was possibly taken from one or more records. The reason for belief is due to no official authenticated signatures, but the information from the chosen records was still recorded and categorized to be included in this data set.</p>
          <p>The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft built a web version of the database, designed to help the public and academic researchers to explore the organized files in a digital setting. The database formatted in this way has allowed for actualization of structural patterns. Creating a digital format for this data was a way to provide an examination on biographical and social information about the accused witches—such as age, sex, marital status, or economic class—and even draw information on what the town was like for the accused. Information like this also falls under a cultural category, including belief systems and legal proceedings of the trials. The interactive maps give insight into national and regional variations, and the chronological and geographical placements of both the accused and prosecutors.</p>
          <p>The raw data is quite extensive, but still lacks datapoints in some areas, which could potentially lead to biases in our analysis. The main issue we encountered in our project was an inability to view the original Microsoft Access database, which contains the data in an accessible format. Without this, the process of cleaning and analyzing the data became far more work than originally necessary, and we were forced to abandon certain lines of analysis when it became apparent that connecting data across multiple tables was not feasible. </p>
          <p><i>The Scottish Devil</i> project specifically examines a small section of the database concerning appearances of the devil as described by those on trial for witchcraft. This data comes from the "WDB DevilAppearance" and "WDB Case" tables, which include information such as key word descriptions, longer descriptions, and notes on the interactions between the accused and the Devil. By narrowing the scope of our analysis to these two tables, we reduced the overwhelming mass of available information to a manageable amount. However, even these tables contain extensive information, and required cleaning to account for spelling errors and inconsistent language. Once our data was finally accessible, we were able to dig into analysis, and consider how accused witches described the Devil across time, and what aspects of Scottish history and culture may have influenced this. </p>

            There are however a couple chapters that discuss the witch hunts. In chapter 1, the book explains that while
            the King has a great interest in everyday people's lives, most people lived not how the King intended but as
            how their land owners desired. This is relevant to considering how witch hunts were conducted. In chapter 5,
            it is explained that in many rural locations, doctors were expensive so many people would turn to local
            healers. These healers were then in several cases tried as witches. Chapter 10 goes into the most depth
            about
            witchcraft, talking about some of the periods that witch hunts were conducted and who was affected and was
            affected by these witch hunts.

            these findings as a way to represent how local and state authorities managed to monopolize powerful speech.

            is
            a story that tells of how a witch escaped a castle by impossibly avoiding soldiers and arrow barrages. The
            story also accounts running from a witch and using a river to escape, because at the time the belief was

            hunts. Later, in chapter 4, it is explained that James IV wrote a “Demonology.” This text looked at the
            secrets of witches and tried to explain why witchcraft was more common with women, essentially very
            misogynistic. A Historical Account of the Belief in Witchcraft in Scotland turned out to be not as directly

            subsistence (hunter-gatherer, forager settlement, pastoral, hand-tool farming, plow agriculture). Witchcraft
            beliefs are uncommon among foraging societies, and more common among pastoral or more advanced farming
            societies. Hierarchy and individualism (modes of social solidarity) push cultures away from the paranoia of
            witchcraft.

            religion at Central Michigan University. Zwissler criticizes the foundational scholarship in the study of
            religion, especially that of Tylor, Frazer, Durkheim, and Freud, whose Euro-centric and Christian-centric
            views historically diminished the role of women, people of color, and non-heteronormative groups in their
            theories on the origins of religion.

            This article is useful in providing some historical context for witches being tried in both religious and
            secular courts. Initially, Christianity did not associate peasants’ folk beliefs with satanic practice;
            these
            beliefs were just untrue. Later, as Christian elites sought to eradicate all competing beliefs, they aligned
            themselves with peasant communities’ fear of witchcraft.

            defined. Definition specific to a project collecting data on accused witches of Scotland during the
            sixteenth
            and seventeenth century. Organized by Stuart Macdonald and published by Edinburgh University Press, this is

            The analysis of the data set helps to give a definition of what is, and is not witchcraft.

            In the piece Henderson: <i>Witchcraft and Folk Belief in the Age of Enlightenment. Scotland, 1670-1740,</i>
            it
            is explained that the field of witchcraft still has continuing potential. This is a relatively short but
            informative piece about themes surrounding witchcraft at this time. One such theme is that while
            enlightenment
            thinkers were skeptical of witchcraft and magic, there was still a very real concern about witches.
            According
            to this piece, Henderson believes that witch beliefs survived well beyond the end of the witch-hunts. The
            final point this piece makes suggests that “witchcraft theory” was used to manipulate, prove, or disprove
            political and religious points of view. Essentially saying that witchcraft, or at least the idea of
            witchcraft, was used to the benefit of politicians and religious figures.
