                <p>The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft is a database containing information about all known individuals
                    accused of witchcraft in early modern Scotland. The database was published in 2003 by Julian
                    Goodare, Lauren Martin, Joyce Miller, and Lousie Yeoman. They intended to “collect collate and
                    record all known information about accused witches and witchcraft belief in a Microsoft Access
                    database and to create a web-based user interface for the database.” The data was collected by first
                    looking at existing surveys of Scottish witchcraft then by archival research over two years by the
                    two full-time researchers, Joyce Miller and Lauren Martin. Charlotte Moon also created a website and
                    database tools for the project. The project director was Dr. Julian Goodare, a professor of Scottish
                    history at the University of Edinburgh. The co-director was Dr. Louise Yeoman, a former curator at
                    the National Library of Scotland and researcher with BBC Scotland.</p>
                <p>The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft used three previous surveys to jump-start the research for their
                    own database. They used George Black’s 1938 <i>Calendar of Cases of Witchcraft in Scotland:
                        1510-1727</i>. The SSW used this non-comprehensive survey because it lists close to 1,000
                    specific trials, and because it includes lists of cases and local published sources. The team did
                    acknowledge that the source was limited because Black did not work with any manuscripts that could
                    have contained more information. The next survey, <i>Source-Book of Scottish Witchcraft</i>, was
                    researched and written by Christia Larner, Christopher Hyde Lee, and Hugh McLachlan, and published
                    in 1977. This survey used manuscripts and had information on 3,000 cases. This survey would be
                    revised by Stuart Macdonald in the 1990s. From this work, McLachlan created the Scottish Witch Hunt
                    Data Base, and from this database the SSW added 1,000 more cases and expanded the information about
                    each case.</p>
                <p>From here, the SSW was expanded from the use of various sources such as <i>Private Papers</i>
                    belonging to the Maxwell of Pollok family, the <i>Burgh Court Books</i>, and <i>Burgh Treasurer’s
                        Accounts</i>, assumed information to specific cases. Miscellaneous manuscript sources were also
                    referenced, such as the <i>Aberdeen City Archives</i>, a box containing items relating to the
                    witchcraft trials from Aberdeen between 1595 and 1597, mostly including paperwork records, as well
                    as printed records of the parliamentary meetings and decisions of Parliament of Scotland. The
                    <i>Miscellany of the Spalding Club Volumes I, IV and V</i>, held edited transcripts of documents
                    from witchcraft trials. These were held in Aberdeen in the 16th century and provided specific case
                    information. The data gathered includes any type of information on trials, lore, investigations,
                    manuals; anything related to witchcraft in Scotland. Examples of this can be seen in all of the
                    sources used to compile this data. <i>Orkney Folklore and Traditions</i> informed the research team
                    of folklore traditions in the Orkney Islands, which also included accusations and specific
                    prosecutions. Witchcraft trials were recorded in edited transcripts from <i>Spottiswoode Miscellany:
                        a collection of original papers and tracts, illustrative chiefly of the civil and ecclesiastical
                        history of Scotland, volume 2</i>. They acquired an edited transcript of the Campbells and
                    hereditary jurisdiction from <i>The Justiciary Records of Argyll and the Isles, volume 1</i>.
                    However, much like many of the references, it is not a complete record of the proceedings, and the
                    source of compilation is unknown, meaning it was possibly taken from one or more records. The reason
                    for belief is due to no official authenticated signatures, but the information from the chosen
                    records was still recorded and categorized to be included in this data set.</p>
                <p>The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft built a web version of the database, designed to help the public
                    and academic researchers to explore the organized files in a digital setting. The database formatted
                    in this way has allowed for structural patterns to be actualized. Providing a digital format for
                    this data was a way to provide an examination on biographical and social information about the
                    accused witches—such as age, sex, marital status, or economic class—and even draw information on
                    what the town was like for the accused. Information like this also falls under a cultural category,
                    like belief systems and legal proceedings of the trials. The interactive maps give insight into
                    national and regional variations, and the chronological and geographical placements of both the
                    accused and prosecutors.</p>
                <p>The raw data is quite extensive, but does have some apparent shortcomings regarding lack of data
                    points in some areas. Lack of data in particular areas could potentially lead to biases. The other
                    main issue when analyzing the data is the inability to view the original Microsoft Access database
                    that the data is contained in. Without this, analyzing the database becomes far more manual and
                    connecting some parts of the database simply is not feasible. As a result, we will have to be
                    mindful of biases that we may bring into the project when sifting through the database.</p>
                <p>In our project, we are looking specifically at a section of the database concerning appearances of
                    the devil as described by those on trial for witchcraft. By narrowing the scope to look at a piece
                    of the database, we reduce the vast amount of data to a manageable chunk. This piece of the database
                    includes information such as brief descriptions, characteristics, and longer descriptions of how the
                    accused described interaction with the devil. Even this single piece contains extensive information,
                    and is not always meaningfully manipulable from the start. This might mean spelling errors,
                    inconsistencies, or other issues that need to be ironed out before analyzing the data. Once these
                    issues are addressed, however, we are able to see how the devil was seen across different witch
                    hunts, and how witch hunting texts of the time may have influenced this.</p>
