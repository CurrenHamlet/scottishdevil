          <p>The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft is a database containing information about all known individuals
            accused of witchcraft in early modern Scotland. The database was published in 2003 by Julian
            Goodare, Lauren Martin, Joyce Miller, and Lousie Yeoman. They intended to “collect collate and
            record all known information about accused witches and witchcraft belief in a Microsoft Access
            database and to create a web-based user interface for the database.” The data was collected by first
            looking at existing surveys of Scottish witchcraft then by archival research over two years by the
            two full-time researchers, Joyce Miller and Lauren Martin. Charlotte Moon also created a website and
            database tools for the project. The project director was Dr. Julian Goodare, a professor of Scottish
            history at the University of Edinburgh. The co-director was Dr. Louise Yeoman, a former curator at
            the National Library of Scotland and researcher with BBC Scotland.</p>
          <p>The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft used three previous surveys to jump-start the research for their
            own database. They used George Black’s 1938 <i>Calendar of Cases of Witchcraft in Scotland:
              1510-1727</i>. The SSW used this non-comprehensive survey because it lists close to 1,000
            specific trials, and because it includes lists of cases and local published sources. The team did
            acknowledge that the source was limited because Black did not work with any manuscripts that could
            have contained more information. The next survey, <i>Source-Book of Scottish Witchcraft</i>, was
            researched and written by Christia Larner, Christopher Hyde Lee, and Hugh McLachlan, and published
            in 1977. This survey used manuscripts and had information on 3,000 cases. This survey would be
            revised by Stuart Macdonald in the 1990s. From this work, McLachlan created the Scottish Witch Hunt
            Data Base, and from this database the SSW added 1,000 more cases and expanded the information about
            each case.</p>
          <p>From here, the SSW was expanded from the use of various sources such as <i>Private Papers</i>
            belonging to the Maxwell of Pollok family, the <i>Burgh Court Books</i>, and <i>Burgh Treasurer’s
              Accounts</i>, assumed information to specific cases. Miscellaneous manuscript sources were also
            referenced, such as the <i>Aberdeen City Archives</i>, a box containing items relating to the
            witchcraft trials from Aberdeen between 1595 and 1597, mostly including paperwork records, as well
            as printed records of the parliamentary meetings and decisions of Parliament of Scotland. The
            <i>Miscellany of the Spalding Club Volumes I, IV and V</i>, held edited transcripts of documents
            from witchcraft trials. These were held in Aberdeen in the 16th century and provided specific case
            information. The data gathered includes any type of information on trials, lore, investigations,
            manuals; anything related to witchcraft in Scotland. Examples of this can be seen in all of the
            sources used to compile this data. <i>Orkney Folklore and Traditions</i> informed the research team
            of folklore traditions in the Orkney Islands, which also included accusations and specific
            prosecutions. Witchcraft trials were recorded in edited transcripts from <i>Spottiswoode Miscellany:
              a collection of original papers and tracts, illustrative chiefly of the civil and ecclesiastical
              history of Scotland, volume 2</i>. They acquired an edited transcript of the Campbells and
            hereditary jurisdiction from <i>The Justiciary Records of Argyll and the Isles, volume 1</i>.
            However, much like many of the references, it is not a complete record of the proceedings, and the
            source of compilation is unknown, meaning it was possibly taken from one or more records. The reason
            for belief is due to no official authenticated signatures, but the information from the chosen
            records was still recorded and categorized to be included in this data set.</p>
          <p>The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft built a web version of the database, designed to help the public
            and academic researchers to explore the organized files in a digital setting. The database formatted
            in this way has allowed for structural patterns to be actualized. Providing a digital format for
            this data was a way to provide an examination on biographical and social information about the
            accused witches—such as age, sex, marital status, or economic class—and even draw information on
            what the town was like for the accused. Information like this also falls under a cultural category,
            like belief systems and legal proceedings of the trials. The interactive maps give insight into
            national and regional variations, and the chronological and geographical placements of both the
            accused and prosecutors.</p>
          <p>The raw data is quite extensive, but does have some apparent shortcomings regarding lack of data
            points in some areas. Lack of data in particular areas could potentially lead to biases. The other
            main issue when analyzing the data is the inability to view the original Microsoft Access database
            that the data is contained in. Without this, analyzing the database becomes far more manual and
            connecting some parts of the database simply is not feasible. As a result, we will have to be
            mindful of biases that we may bring into the project when sifting through the database.</p>
          <p>In our project, we are looking specifically at a section of the database concerning appearances of
            the devil as described by those on trial for witchcraft. By narrowing the scope to look at a piece
            of the database, we reduce the vast amount of data to a manageable chunk. This piece of the database
            includes information such as brief descriptions, characteristics, and longer descriptions of how the
            accused described interaction with the devil. Even this single piece contains extensive information,
            and is not always meaningfully manipulable from the start. This might mean spelling errors,
            inconsistencies, or other issues that need to be ironed out before analyzing the data. Once these
            issues are addressed, however, we are able to see how the devil was seen across different witch
            hunts, and how witch hunting texts of the time may have influenced this.</p>

            There are however a couple chapters that discuss the witch hunts. In chapter 1, the book explains that while
            the King has a great interest in everyday people's lives, most people lived not how the King intended but as
            how their land owners desired. This is relevant to considering how witch hunts were conducted. In chapter 5,
            it is explained that in many rural locations, doctors were expensive so many people would turn to local
            healers. These healers were then in several cases tried as witches. Chapter 10 goes into the most depth
            about
            witchcraft, talking about some of the periods that witch hunts were conducted and who was affected and was
            affected by these witch hunts.

            is
            a story that tells of how a witch escaped a castle by impossibly avoiding soldiers and arrow barrages. The
            story also accounts running from a witch and using a river to escape, because at the time the belief was

            In chapter 2, the execution of Lady Janet Douglas and her family is highlighted. The reason for her

            was the murder of James by poison or witchcraft. This event showed that even nobles were at risk of witch
            hunts. Later, in chapter 4, it is explained that James IV wrote a “Demonology.” This text looked at the
            secrets of witches and tried to explain why witchcraft was more common with women, essentially very
            misogynistic. A Historical Account of the Belief in Witchcraft in Scotland turned out to be not as directly

            This article is useful as a potential explanation for why rates of witch accusations increased during

            subsistence (hunter-gatherer, forager settlement, pastoral, hand-tool farming, plow agriculture). Witchcraft
            beliefs are uncommon among foraging societies, and more common among pastoral or more advanced farming
            societies. Hierarchy and individualism (modes of social solidarity) push cultures away from the paranoia of
            witchcraft.

            This source is an article from the journal of Religions by Laurel Zwissler, a professor of philosophy and
            religion at Central Michigan University. Zwissler criticizes the foundational scholarship in the study of
            religion, especially that of Tylor, Frazer, Durkheim, and Freud, whose Euro-centric and Christian-centric
            views historically diminished the role of women, people of color, and non-heteronormative groups in their
            theories on the origins of religion.

            This article is useful in providing some historical context for witches being tried in both religious and
            secular courts. Initially, Christianity did not associate peasants’ folk beliefs with satanic practice;
            these
            beliefs were just untrue. Later, as Christian elites sought to eradicate all competing beliefs, they aligned
            themselves with peasant communities’ fear of witchcraft.

            defined. Definition specific to a project collecting data on accused witches of Scotland during the
            sixteenth

            The analysis of the data set helps to give a definition of what is, and is not witchcraft.

            In the piece Henderson: <i>Witchcraft and Folk Belief in the Age of Enlightenment. Scotland, 1670-1740,</i>
            it
            is explained that the field of witchcraft still has continuing potential. This is a relatively short but
            informative piece about themes surrounding witchcraft at this time. One such theme is that while
            enlightenment
            thinkers were skeptical of witchcraft and magic, there was still a very real concern about witches.
            According
            to this piece, Henderson believes that witch beliefs survived well beyond the end of the witch-hunts. The
            final point this piece makes suggests that “witchcraft theory” was used to manipulate, prove, or disprove
            political and religious points of view. Essentially saying that witchcraft, or at least the idea of
            witchcraft, was used to the benefit of politicians and religious figures.
