            <p>Our major object of study with this project is the physical description of the Devil during witch trials in early modern Scotland. The Devil was a recurring character during the trial proceedings, and witches were commonly accused of sleeping with the Devil or making a demonic pact. The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft database from the University of Edinburgh (2003) contains records of hundreds of such trials dating between 1563 and 1736. We used these records as the foundation of our own analysis. Our use of primary sources included witch hunting codexes like King James VI Daemonologie (1580) and  Discourse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft (1625). Records that reference the Devil’s appearance occur throughout the timeline of the database, but our primary focus is on four periods of “panic” when witch accusations spiked in 1597-1598, 1628-1631, 1649, and 1661-1662. Each of these spikes contain 100 accusations in a year. These spikes are also identified by the project manager for the Survey as the major hunts. Although descriptions of the Devil still vary within these periods, we were able to observe major patterns among them using textual analysis tools like Voyant. For example, during the panic of 1597-1598, many records identify the Devil as appearing as some sort of animal, whereas in 1661-1662, “black” is the most common descriptor. We also compared our findings from the Survey to descriptions of the Devil from witch hunting texts of the time. From the time comparison we  This project seeks to display the patterns we observed using original graphics and analytical data visualizations, as well as pull from secondary sources to contextualize our findings and identify the possible causes behind them. <br><br>Many scholars of early modern Scottish history have made a point to try to correct misconceptions about the witch hunts and create a more nuanced understanding of the Scottish witch hunts. This project takes a different approach than correcting misconceptions, instead we aim to build off of nuanced narratives to understand a particular facet of the witch hunts in Scotland, the Devil.Currently the leading narrative is that the fear of witches is a phenomenon that was spread by the higher classes of Scotland (Levack).A consequence of this understanding of the Scottish witch hunts is that it causes researchers to focus a lot on the witch hunters, as vectors of spreading the fear of witchcraft to communities.  Senior scholars like Dr. Julian Goodare, the project manager for the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, see the future of Scottish witch hunt studies in examining hunters and the victims. By doing this scholars can look at the individuals that initiated the hunts and in turn see why some hunts, like the four major ones which we will be focusing on, had many more victims.  During our interview with Goodare, we discussed new avenues not yet fully explored by scholars of early modern Scotland. One major research route that has yet to be explored very deeply was questions based on the varied appearances of the Devil in early modern Scotland.

            Based on the lack of previous research into the Devil’s appearance, we intend our project to lay the groundwork for future scholars interested in this topic. The variations among descriptions from these trials point to larger cultural patterns in early modern Scottish society. Compared to the first major witch hunt in 1597-1598, the frequency of representations of the Devil as a man, especially with black skin or clothes, increased dramatically by the fourth major hunt in 1661-1662. At the same time, representations of spirit or animal Devils decreased between these eras. [details about geographic variation tbd] [details about comparison to contemporary texts?] These changes may be the effect of the increasing prevalence of racism within early modern Scotland, as well as religious leaders’ attempts to root out the pagan beliefs that spirit and animal forms reflect. In this way, changes in the popular descriptions of the Devil reflect broader social movements outside the structure of the witch hunts themselves.</p>
