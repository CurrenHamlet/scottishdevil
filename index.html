                <p>Our major object of study with this project is the physical description of the Devil during witch
                    trials in early modern Scotland. The Devil was a recurring character during the trial proceedings,
                    and witches were commonly accused of sleeping with the Devil or making a demonic pact. The Survey of
                    Scottish Witchcraft database from the University of Edinburgh (2003) contains records of hundreds of
                    such trials dating between 1563 and 1736. We used these records as the foundation of our own
                    analysis. Our use of primary sources included witch hunting codexes like King James VI’s
                    <i>Daemonologie</i> (1580) and <i>Discourse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft</i> (1625). Records that
                    reference the Devil’s appearance occur throughout the timeline of the database, but our primary
                    focus is on four periods of “panic” when witch accusations spiked in 1597-1598, 1628-1631, 1649, and
                    1661-1662. Each of these spikes contain at least 100 accusations in a year. Dr. Julian Goodare, the
                    director of the Survey, identified these spikes as the major witch hunts of this era. Although
                    descriptions of the Devil still vary within these periods, we were able to observe major patterns
                    among them using textual analysis tools like Voyant. For example, during the panic of 1597-1598,
                    many records identify the Devil as appearing as some sort of animal, whereas in 1661-1662, “black”
                    is the most common descriptor. We also compared our findings from the Survey to descriptions of the
                    Devil from witch hunting texts of the time. This project seeks to display the patterns we observed
                    using original graphics and analytical data visualizations, as well as pull from secondary sources
                    to contextualize our findings and identify the possible causes behind them. </p>
                <p>According to Brian Levack in his book <i>The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe</i>, the leading
                    narrative for the origins of witch hunting in Scotland is that fear of witches spread from the upper
                    classes of society to the lower classes. Based on this theory, researchers have tended to focus
                    their studies on powerful witch hunters who spread the fear of witchcraft to smaller Scottish
                    communities. Our project seeks to expand on a relatively unexplored topic that was nonetheless
                    central to any witch hunt—the Devil. During our interview with Dr. Goodare, he mentioned that one
                    interesting research area yet to be deeply explored is the confessions that accused witches produce,
                    whether under torture or of their own free will. These confessions vary widely; many align with the
                    standard narrative of the Devil’s appearance and temptation, but others include unique details of
                    magic, fairies, or animal spirits. Where do these various narratives originate? What can we learn
                    from patterns within this variation? </p>
                <p>Based on the lack of previous research into the Devil’s appearance, we intend our project to lay the
                    groundwork for future scholars interested in this topic. The variations among descriptions from
                    these trials point to larger cultural patterns in early modern Scottish society. Compared to the
                    first major witch hunt in 1597-1598, the frequency of representations of the Devil as a man,
                    especially with black skin or clothes, increased dramatically by the fourth major hunt in 1661-1662.
                    At the same time, representations of spirit or animal Devils decreased between these eras. These
                    changes may be the effect of the increasing prevalence of racism within early modern Scotland, as
                    well as religious leaders’ attempts to root out the pagan beliefs that spirit and animal forms
                    reflect. In this way, changes in the popular descriptions of the Devil reflect broader social
                    movements outside the structure of the witch hunts themselves. </p>
