            <div class="row cont type">
                <p>Our major object of study with this project is the physical description of the Devil during witch
                    trials in early modern Scotland. The Devil was a recurring character during the trial proceedings,
                    and witches were commonly accused of sleeping with the Devil or making a demonic pact. The Survey of
                    Scottish Witchcraft database from the University of Edinburgh (2003) contains records of hundreds of
                    such trials dating between 1563 and 1736. We used these records as the foundation of our own
                    analysis. Our use of primary sources included witch hunting codexes like King James VI’s
                    <i>Daemonologie</i> (1580) and <i>Discourse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft</i> (1625). Records that
                    reference the Devil’s appearance occur throughout the timeline of the database, but our primary
                    focus is on four periods of “panic” when witch accusations spiked in 1597-1598, 1628-1631, 1649, and
                    1661-1662. Each of these spikes contain at least 100 accusations in a year. Professor Julian Goodare, the
                    director of the Survey, identified these spikes as the major witch hunts of this era. Although
                    descriptions of the Devil still vary within these periods, we were able to observe major patterns
                    among them using textual analysis tools like Voyant. For example, during the panic of 1597-1598,
                    many records identify the Devil as appearing as some sort of animal, whereas in 1661-1662, “black”
                    is the most common descriptor. We also compared our findings from the Survey to descriptions of the
                    Devil from witch hunting texts of the time. This project seeks to display the patterns we observed
                    using original graphics and analytical data visualizations, as well as pull from secondary sources
                    to contextualize our findings and identify the possible causes behind them. </p>
                <p>According to Brian Levack in his book <i>The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe</i>, the leading
                    narrative for the origins of witch hunting in Scotland is that fear of witches spread from the upper
                    classes of society to the lower classes. Based on this theory, researchers have tended to focus
                    their studies on powerful witch hunters who spread the fear of witchcraft to smaller Scottish
                    communities. Our project seeks to expand on a relatively unexplored topic that was nonetheless
                    central to any witch hunt—the Devil. During our interview with Professor Goodare, he mentioned that one
                    interesting research area yet to be deeply explored is the confessions that accused witches produce,
                    whether under torture or of their own free will. These confessions vary widely; many align with the
                    standard narrative of the Devil’s appearance and temptation, but others include unique details of
                    magic, fairies, or animal spirits. Where do these various narratives originate? What can we learn
                    from patterns within this variation? </p>
                <p>Based on the lack of previous research into the Devil’s appearance, we intend our project to lay the
                    groundwork for future scholars interested in this topic. The variations among descriptions from
                    these trials point to larger cultural patterns in early modern Scottish society. Compared to the
                    first major witch hunt in 1597-1598, the frequency of representations of the Devil as a man,
                    especially with black skin or clothes, increased dramatically by the fourth major hunt in 1661-1662.
                    At the same time, representations of spirit or animal Devils decreased between these eras. These
                    changes may be the effect of the increasing prevalence of racism within early modern Scotland, as
                    well as religious leaders’ attempts to root out the pagan beliefs that spirit and animal forms
                    reflect. In this way, changes in the popular descriptions of the Devil reflect broader social
                    movements outside the structure of the witch hunts themselves. </p>

                <p>In 1597, Jonat Lucas worked as a healer in her local Aberdeen community. She used threads of
                    different color and length to provide diagnosis, prognosis, and cures for illness, but the threads
                    didn’t always tell what her patients wanted to hear. One day, Lucas came to the home of a man whose
                    wife felt ill, and her threads delivered good news: the wife had no fever, and her illness was not
                    bewitched. According to the wife, however, the healer’s skills were not to be trusted, for she
                    served the Devil in secret. While Lucas tended to the woman, the walls of the house began to shake.
                    It was only dogs running nearby, Lucas assured, but the creature that entered the house was much
                    more fearsome: the Devil, in the form of a four-footed beast. The husband and wife cowered on their
                    bed in fear. According to the husband, Lucas promised the Devil would continue to appear until he
                    returned all his stolen property to its rightful owners. Lucas denied the claims, but ultimately,
                    she was banished from county Aberdeen. </p>

                <p>In 1624, just before noon at Michaelmas, Alexander Hammiltoun met a man on the Hugstoun Hills,
                    dressed all in black: the Devil. A penniless vagabond from Newcastle, Hammiltoun was enticed by the
                    terms of the Devil’s pact. He would want for nothing, the man promised; not meat, nor clothing, nor
                    money. In exchange, Hammiltoun entered into the Devil’s service. For the price of an animal—a cat or
                    a dog—Hammiltoun received a wand that he could use to raise the Devil, and four silver shillings in
                    his pocket. From then on, according to Hammiltoun, he attended many witches meetings with the Devil,
                    often held at noon on the hilltops, or in the valleys and forests around the country. </p>

                <p>In the late 1640s, Margrat NcWilliam encountered a strange young man. He was well-favored, handsomely
                    dressed in a green suit, and above all, promised to raise her out of her poverty—if she helped him
                    in return. There was only one catch; this man was the Devil. She was reluctant to agree, and fought
                    against his advances. He made his offer twice, and twice she refused. Suddenly he grabbed her leg,
                    leaving a mark, and asked a third time for her service. In pain, she agreed to help him; as soon as
                    she spoke the word, the Devil put his mouth to her leg to heal the sore. </p>
                <p>Although he promised she would want for nothing, the Devil’s help came at a steep price. First, she
                    gave him a gift of a chicken. Soon, however, he asked for something more precious: the life of her
                    son. He gave her an elf-shot, an arrow from the elves that leaves invisible wounds. Unable to
                    rescind her agreement, NcWilliam used the elf-shot on her son, who died of his wounds ten days
                    later. </p>

            <p>In January of 1662, Jonet Morisone was coming home to Rothesay parish at twilight when she came upon a
                fierce black man waiting in the dark. He spoke to her sweetly, promising to raise her out of poverty and
                make her a great Lady in a castle, if she agreed to go with him. At once, she recognized the tricks of
                the Devil. His words were tempting, but she refused the offer. He grabbed her hand and made the offer
                again, adding that he would teach her how to “bring home” Adam Ker, a man recently killed in the
                community. With his grip tight around her hand, she agreed to meet him again soon. </p>

                <h3 id="analysis>Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, this project frames its analysis on the theory that a majority of individuals accused of practicing witchcraft were not, in fact, witches. According to Levac [?], although many accused witches confessed their own guilt, these confessions often came under threat or pain of torture, at which point the accused parroted the prevailing story that those in power—witch hunters and others involved in the witch-hunting system—wanted to hear. This framework holds that the fear of witchcraft and the phenomena of witch-hunting are learned skills which begin in the upper classes of a society, spread by way of witch-hunting codexes, traveling witch hunters, and professional demonologists. The trending fear then transfers to lower classes by way of sermons, public meetings, and general conversation (Levack, 26). With this framework applied to our area of interest—appearances of the Devil during the major Scottish witch hunts—a series of questions arise. First, is there a significant change in the representation of the Devil’s appearance over time? Second, if this change is significant, what does the variation mean? Who benefits? Who suffers? And what happened in Scotland to cause this change? </p>
                <p>To address these questions, we begin with several visualizations of the quantitative data. The word trees in figures 1-4 break down how many times each color appears in the data and what it describes (men, clothing, hair, animals, or other items). These trees provide much-needed context for each descriptor, but they lack a comparative goal. Figures 5 and 6 compare the most common words associated with the Devil’s appearance in each of the four major hunts. Figure 5 displays the frequency of different colors in the data, while Figure 6 displays the frequency of different forms the Devil took (male, female, animal, etc). </p>
                <p>Looking at the comparative graphs, the significance of variations in the data remains hard to determine. In Figure 5, the frequency of “black” increases slightly from 2.8% in the 1597-98 hunt to 7.6% in 1661-62. Figures 1-4 also indicate that “black” consistently describes animals, clothing, and/or men during each of the hunts. While the consistent prevalence of “black” as a descriptor for the Devil is noteworthy, the change in frequency does not appear statistically significant. More significant variation appears in Figure 6, with the usage of “male” and “animal” describing the Devil’s form. The graph shows an increase “male” forms rising between each hunt, from a low of 6.4% in 1597-98 to a high of 21.9% in 1661-62. Conversely, the appearance of “animal” forms decreases over the same years from 11.9% to 3.2%. Even without statistical analysis, the shift from identifying the Devil predominantly as an animal to almost entirely as a man constitutes a significant change in less than 100 years of popular conception. But, the question remains, what does this change in the Devil from an animal to a man signify? </p>
                <p>The first place to look for the Devil is Christian discourse. The Witchcraft act of 1563 passed in Scotland three years after the Scottish reformation. By the 1560, protestants made up a large majority of the country, and established the Protestant National Church in 1567 (Levack 105). Early protestant writers such as Martin Luther and Jean Calvin approached the topic of the Devil similarly to their medieval Catholic predecessors, who claimed that the Devil is present in the world of men, and will attempt to harm people both physically and spiritually. Protestants, however, stressed the significance of spiritual damage more. They claimed that the Devil works as a trickster and tries to deceive humans into doing wrong. Despite this, protestant writers did not necessarily connect the Devil to witchcraft. Instead, the general awareness that demonic powers may be afoot made individuals more suspicious of magic and witches within their community (Levack 96-98). The Devil’s early appearance as an animal, who can harm people physically, suggests remnants from the Catholic version of the Devil. As protestant thinking becomes more widespread, the Devil morphs into a man who can harm people spiritually, by causing them to live immoral lives. This shift is evident in the narrative examples above. Jonat Lucas’s case in 1597 describes the Devil in the shape of “a four-footed beast,” who threatens a man with its physical presence. In Jonet Morisone’s case, however, the Devil appears as a man who tempts her with immoral desires, including wealth and bringing a man back from the dead. While his physical presence does pose a threat, his words are what cause her downfall, demonstrating the spiritual harm that Protestant writers warned against. </p>
                <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>While the decline of Catholic thinking in a newly Protestant country posed a significant influence on the shift in appearance of the Devil, other factors certainly remain. The visual timeline above includes the publication dates of major witch hunting codexes, which were often directly followed by witch hunts. These codexes acted as a vessel for witch paranoia in communities, and as a primer for new witch hunters. Descriptions of the Devil found in codexes could yield fruitful material for other projects to continue exploring this topic. Voyant and other, more nuanced digital humanities tools allow for easy breakdown of complex primary sources, and would aid in the future analysis of these texts. </p>
                <p>As the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database exemplifies, the Scottish witch hunts provide a well of valuable data for digital humanities scholars to examine. Further research will no doubt uncover more compelling stories to tell and lessons to learn from this period of history. In this examination, we treated witch hunting as a learned skill, first circulated among upper classes in Scotland, and later spread to the general population. A flaw in this theory that we had to work around is evident in a handful of cases that in which descriptions of witchcraft and the Devil deviate drastically from what was otherwise the norm at the time. Some confessions involve interactions with elves, or intricate blood rituals, that appear to have no bearing on previous conceptions of witchcraft in these communities. Did these accused witches come up with a fantastical narrative before they were forced to adhere to the standard? What inspired these deviations? What was the role of the lower classes’ folk culture and pagan beliefs in shaping these unique descriptions of the Devil? Future scholars can and should continue to examine this data set, as it still contains a plethora of fascinating information, with the potential to shake the hegemonic theories of this field. </p>
